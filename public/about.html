<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Experienced mobile app developer with a track record of immense success in
  creating, improving, fixing, and testing apps in Flutter (Android, IOS, and
  Web). Skilled in both: independent work and teamwork. Enthusiast learner and
  passionate for growth.
</p>

<p>
  I have worked in many technologies and programming languages during and after
  my degree including Python, JAVA, SQL, and Kotlin. Without an ounce of doubt,
  I say that my strongest skill is flutter and dart as it has been my only focus
  during the last three years. I was promoted to frontend team lead due to my
  significant contribution, effective communication, and conflict-resolving
  capabilities. Ainâ€™t reluctant to seek solutions outside the box. My employers
  have been at complete ease entrusting me with flutter projects. I am flexible
  to work with different people, trying new things, learning new methods, and
  approaching tasks from different perspectives. I aim to take on a leadership
  role, pursue expertise in mobile app development, consider management
  positions, and continuously update my skills while exploring new and
  innovative ways to contribute to the software industry.
